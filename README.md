## 🌟 The Vision

Have you ever wondered what it's truly like to run at top speed? This project brings that incredible experience to life. Players get to choose between the **cheetah** and the **peregrine falcon** (as the two fastest animals on earth, though one flies!), offering unique gameplay centered on extreme velocity. Our goal is to create a realistic, high-speed simulation that is both thrilling and respectful of these magnificent creatures' natural abilities.
